**Intelligent Transportation System**

We used **Node.js and React.js** to develop this project, which aims to reduce the time Philadelphia residents spend in traffic jams.
The system employs V2X (vehicle-to-vehicle) communication technology, enabling vehicles to share information about their speed and obstacles on the road. 
This not only improves time efficiency but also enhances fuel efficiency, as cars equipped with V2X technology can communicate to maintain a constant speed, 
avoiding unnecessary stops at traffic lights.
This contributes to reducing fuel consumption and, ultimately, helps combat global warming.
