**Ultra Intelligent Transportation System**

We used **Node.js and React.js** to develop this project, which aims to reduce the time spent traveling.

The system employs V2X (vehicle-to-everything) communication technology, enabling vehicles to share information about their speed, destination, and travel time with nearby vehicles.
Using the speed, destination, and travel time of various cars, we will accelerate and decelerate them accordingly to reduce their travel time significantly.

This not only improves time efficiency but also enhances fuel efficiency, as cars equipped with V2X technology can communicate to maintain a constant speed, 
avoiding unnecessary stops at traffic lights.

This contributes to reducing fuel consumption, and ultimately, helps combat global warming.
